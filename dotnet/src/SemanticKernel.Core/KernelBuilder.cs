/// via the standard <see cref="IServiceProvider"/> interface, and plugins via a <see cref="KernelPluginCollection"/>.
/// <see cref="KernelBuilder"/> makes it easy to compose those services and plugins via a fluent
/// interface. In particular, <see cref="WithServices"/> allows for extension methods off of
/// <see cref="IServiceCollection"/> to be used to register services, and <see cref="M:WithPlugins"/>
/// allows for plugins to be constructed and added to the collection, having been handed a reference
/// to the <see cref="IServiceProvider"/>, in case it's needed for resolving services, e.g. a <see cref="HttpClient"/>
/// or <see cref="ILoggerFactory"/> that might be used by the plugin. Once composed, the builder's
/// <see cref="Build"/> method produces a new <see cref="Kernel"/> instance.
